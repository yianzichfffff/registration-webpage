This webpage serves as a simple yet interactive registration form designed to capture user information, including a username, email, and password. 
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides real-time input validation to ensure that users meet the required criteria before submission, 
such as a minimum username length, valid email format, and secure password length. To enhance user experience, the form displays clear feedback 
messages, indicating either errors or successful registration. Additionally, the page features a theme toggle that allows users to switch between 
light and dark modes, creating a visually dynamic and user-friendly interface.
